# Molecular Formula to IUPAC Name Converter Bot

This Telegram bot converts molecular formulas to their corresponding IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) names. Simply send a molecular formula to the bot, and it will respond with the IUPAC name of the compound.

## Features

- Converts molecular formulas to IUPAC names
- Easy to use within Telegram
- Provides quick and accurate responses
- Integrated contact options (WhatsApp, Email, and Map links)
- Main menu for easy access to bot features

## How to Use

1. Start a chat with the bot on Telegram: [@YourBotUsername]
2. Send a molecular formula (e.g., "C3H8", "H2O", "C6H12O6")
3. The bot will reply with the IUPAC name of the compound

## Examples

- Input: `C3H8`  
  Output: Propane

- Input: `H2O`  
  Output: Water

- Input: `C6H12O6`  
  Output: Hexose

## Technical Details

This bot is built using **Python** and the **python-telegram-bot** library. It uses custom logic for determining the IUPAC names based on molecular formulas.

### Key Libraries:
- `python-telegram-bot`: To handle Telegram Bot API.
- `dotenv`: To securely manage environment variables like the Telegram bot token.

## Setting up the Bot

Follow these instructions to run this bot on your local machine or deploy it to a server.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** installed.

   To get your bot token:
   - Go to Telegram, search for [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather), and start a chat.
   - Use `/newbot` to create a new bot.
   - Follow the instructions, and BotFather will give you a token. Keep this token safe.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/molecular-formula-bot.git
cd molecular-formula-bot
